# Dog and Cat Detection Using Deep Learning (YOLOv8)

## Project Description:

This project builds an object detection model using the YOLOv8 deep learning framework to identify and classify dogs and cats from image data. The model utilizes a dataset downloaded through the Roboflow platform and demonstrates the essential workflow of a computer vision detection pipeline, including dataset preparation, model configuration, training, and evaluation.

The project provides hands-on understanding of how modern object detection architectures can be applied to real-world image classification and localization problems.
